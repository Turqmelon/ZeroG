# ZeroG
Changed gravity and combat physics of a server based on the equipped armor. Requested by JeromeASF for a video.

### Armor Modifications
- Leather Boots: 0.8 Gravity
- Gold/Chain Boots: 0.6 Gravity
- Iron Boots: 0.4 Gravity
- Diamond Boots: 0.2 Gravity

Projectiles launched/shot while wearing armor carry your velocity.

Entities attacked by you (or hit by your projectiles) will inherit your gravity for a short time. (750ms * DMG)
